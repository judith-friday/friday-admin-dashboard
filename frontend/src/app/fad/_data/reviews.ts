/**
 * Reviews module — Phase 1 fixture (read-from-Reva model).
 *
 * Phase 1 reads reviews + tags + staff attribution from Reva's API. This
 * fixture mirrors the shape that integration will return so downstream UI
 * can be built against it now. Schema deliberately matches the §8 schema
 * sketch in `~/Desktop/FAD Modules Scoping/reviews_scoping_pack.md`.
 *
 * Cross-link primary keys:
 *  - reservationId → `reservations.ts:RESERVATION_BY_ID`
 *  - propertyCode  → `tasks.ts:TASK_PROPERTY_BY_CODE`
 *  - staff (cleaner/inspector) → `tasks.ts:TASK_USER_BY_ID`
